# About
This repository includes the surrogate Hessian subspace optimization and saddle-point search algorithms based on the manuscript 'Force-free identification of minimum-energy pathways and transition states for stochastic electronic structure theories' by Iyer, Whelpley, Tiihonen, Kent, Krogel, and Rubenstein (2024).

# Prerequisites
To reproduce the results in this manuscript, you will need to have access to the original [surrogate Hessian line-search](https://github.com/QMCPACK/surrogate_hessian_relax/tree/master) code and add it to your `PYTHONPATH`.
